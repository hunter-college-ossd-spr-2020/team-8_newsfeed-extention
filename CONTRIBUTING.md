Guidelines for examples
Examples should:

-have a clear function, that's easy to explain and understand
-focus on demonstrating how to use the WebExtension technology, minimizing any complex logic that's extraneous to the WebExtension technology itself
-demonstrate good-practice use of the technology, even at the expense of extra complexity

Code Style: 
If you're editing an existing file, code style should be consistent with the rest of the code in the file.
